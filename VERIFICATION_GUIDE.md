# Floating Point Fix - Verification Guide

## Problem Fixed
Individual expenses displayed correctly, but all calculated fields (totals, summaries, user spending breakdowns) showed corrupted values with 20+ digits and multiple dots.

## Root Cause
After migration from `DoublePrecision` to `Decimal(10,2)`, Prisma was returning Decimal objects. When JavaScript tried to add them (e.g., in `.reduce()`), it performed string concatenation instead of numeric addition:
```javascript
// Before fix:
0 + Decimal('50.5')  → "050.5" (string)
// After fix:
0 + 50.5  → 50.5 (number)
```

## Changes Made

### 1. New Utility (backend/src/utils/decimalUtils.ts)
- Function: `convertDecimalsToNumbers()`
- Purpose: Recursively converts all Prisma Decimal objects to JavaScript numbers
- Coverage: Handles primitives, objects, arrays, and nested structures

### 2. Updated Routes
All endpoints that return monetary amounts now convert Decimals:
- **Group Routes**: `GET /api/groups`, `GET /api/groups/:id`, `GET /api/groups/:id/summary`, `POST /api/groups`, etc.
- **Expense Routes**: `GET /api/expenses`, `GET /api/expenses/:id`, `POST /api/expenses`, `PUT /api/expenses/:id`
- **Payment Routes**: `GET /api/payments`, `GET /api/payments/:id`, `POST /api/payments`, `PUT /api/payments/:id`
- **Reminder Routes**: All endpoints that return reminder data with amounts
- **WebSocket**: `expense-added` event emission

## Verification Steps

### Backend Verification
1. Build succeeds: ✅ `npm run build` completes without errors
2. No TypeScript errors
3. All Decimal → number conversions applied consistently

### Frontend Verification (When Deployed)
Check these UI components for correct number display:

1. **HomePage** (`frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx`)
   - Total group spending should show as normal currency (e.g., "1,234.56 TL")
   - Member spending breakdown should calculate correctly
   - No 20-digit numbers or multiple dots

2. **GroupPage** (`frontend/src/pages/GroupPage.tsx`)
   - Expense list amounts display correctly
   - Debt settlement calculations show proper values
   - Sum of individual expenses = group total

3. **GroupSpendingSummary** (`frontend/src/components/GroupSpendingSummary.tsx`)
   - Line 287: `expenses.reduce((sum, expense) => sum + expense.amount, 0)` should work
   - Line 307: `userSpending.total += expense.amount` should accumulate correctly
   - Monthly view totals should match individual expenses

4. **AnalyticsPage** 
   - Charts should display correct values
   - No weird spikes or data anomalies

### Test Cases
1. **Create Expense**: Add expense with amount "50.50" → Should display as "50.50 TL"
2. **View Summary**: Check total spending → Should be sum of all amounts
3. **Multiple Expenses**: Add 3 expenses (10, 20, 30) → Total should be 60
4. **Debt Settlement**: View who owes whom → Calculations should be accurate
5. **Monthly View**: Check month totals → Should match sum of expenses in that month

## Expected Behavior
- All amounts display as clean currency values (e.g., "123.45 TL")
- Calculations (totals, averages, balances) are mathematically correct
- No string concatenation artifacts (like "0100.50" or "50.5050.50")

## Rollback (if needed)
If issues arise, the fix can be safely removed by:
1. Remove `convertDecimalsToNumbers()` calls from all routes
2. The API will return raw Prisma Decimal objects (like before)
3. Frontend calculations will break again (original issue returns)

## Database Schema
No database changes required - this is purely a data serialization fix. The `Decimal(10,2)` column type is correct and should remain.
